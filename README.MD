# 🤖 Machine Learning Self-Study by tunguyenn99

Welcome to my personal **machine learning notebook collection**!  
This repository is part of my journey to learn, practice, and apply machine learning concepts through hands-on experiments using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

The notebooks are organized by topic, covering both foundational techniques and advanced models—from linear regression to ensemble learning.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core language for all implementations  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – Interactive development and experimentation  
- **Scikit-learn** – Classical ML algorithms  
- **XGBoost / CatBoost** – Gradient boosting frameworks  
- **mlxtend / apyori** – For association rule mining

## 📌 Learning Philosophy

> "Learn by doing. Understand by breaking things. Master by teaching."

Each notebook follows a simple structure:
- 📖 **Concept overview**
- 🧪 **Step-by-step code demo**
- 🧠 **Explanation & visualization**
- 📝 **Personal notes or insights**

This repo will continuously evolve as I explore more ML concepts (like NLP, model deployment, and MLOps).

## ✅ Next Topics (Coming Soon)
- Deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras  
- Feature selection techniques  
- Model evaluation & cross-validation best practices  
- Real-world project pipelines
